# RESTful-API-Uptime-Monitoring-App
# Boahen Elijah Owusu Ewooral owns the design 

## I am building a RESTful API for an uptime monitoring application using no npm module nor dependencies but rather just a large chunk of the features available in the Node JS library. I will add some tests and refactor a little bit to make this application better and a bit robust overall.

# What is an UPTIME MONITOR?
* An uptime monitor allows users to enter URLs they want monitored, and receive alerts when those resources go down or come back up. 

* The App should be useable, so I'll include features such as sign-up and sign-in.
